# The-Bee-Game

To run the project:
- tsc in terminal
- open html / go live in vs code

# Game play

The game has 3 types of bees: Queen (100HP), Worker (75HP), Drone (50HP).
The UI has 3 pages: 
- Landing page: Name input + Start button
- Game page: Name + Legend + Attack button
- Game over page: Restart button + Exit button

The legend displays the number of alive bees per type and the health of the sworm.
When the bees are randomly attacked, the damage is displayed.
The game is persistent between different browser sessions.

To do:
- Unit tests (tried, but got some errors regarding mocha)
